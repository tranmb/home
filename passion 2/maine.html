            looking at the pictures, it feels like i've been in this house before. something about the wood paneling walls and matching cabinets feels so homey and familiar. similar to any house on this list, it has giant windows. though in this house, a cobblestone fireplace sits at the forefront of the living room, almost stealing attention from the view of the water.
