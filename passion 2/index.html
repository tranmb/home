                <p class="description">one of the first houses i saved on zillow. it has gigantic windows and the best built-in bookshelves i have ever seen. it's right on the water and next to a private dock. the roof is green copper and has an octogonal princess tower built into the side. </p>

                <p class="description">this is the kind of house that fictional characters miraculously inherit in lifetime movies. the landscaping is beautiful, it's like you are right in the center of your own little forest. the balcony is gigantic and hovers above the water, and the natural light is endless with floor to ceilings windows in every room. </p>

                </ul>

                <p class="description">looking at the pictures, it feels like i've been in this house before. something about the wood paneling walls and matching cabinets feels so homey and familiar. similar to any house on this list, it has giant windows. though in this house, a cobblestone fireplace sits at the forefront of the living room, almost stealing attention from the view of the water. </p>
