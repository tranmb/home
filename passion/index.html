        <h1>Zillow Houses I'd like to Live in Forever.</h1>
        <h4>Oscassionally, I like to spend time scrolling through million dollar homes on Zillow in beach towns. I visit them on google earth to check out the area and imagine myself living there. Here is an archive of some of my favorites so I can keep looking at them after they are sold.</h4>

        <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/84-Harbor-Ave-Marblehead-MA-01945/56942695_zpid/">Marblehead, MA</a>
        
        <ul>
            <li>3.6 M</li>
            <li>3 Bed/3 Bath</li>
            <li>3,184 sqft</li>
       
        </ul>
       
        <p>This house is the first house I saved on zillow. It has gigantic windows and the best built-in bookshelves I have ever seen. It's right on the water and is next to a private dock. The roof is green copper and features a three story octogonal tower.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1.4 M</li>
            <li>2 Bed/3 Bath</li>
            <li>2,150 sqft</li>
        </ul>

        <p> This house is directly on the water with gorgeous landscaping. The view from the kitchen is like you're standing on a beach and opens into a large balcony. The windows in the living room are large and encompass the room, providing the area with endless natural sunlight.</p>
