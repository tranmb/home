        <summary>What is a Website by Laurel Schwulst</summary>
        <p>I was never able to pinpoint the source of my anxiety when it came to social media. Laurel writes that social media today prioritizes advertising above their users' happiness. Reading that was almost like an aha moment. I very easily get overwhelmed on social media — often avoiding it all together. Part of that is because of the sheer amount of unwanted information being thrown at you from all sides. And the worst part is that the only reason it's there is because someone paid for it to be there. I understand why it's important for individuals to guide the web's future. The peace one can find in a simplistic, handmade, website made only to give the user a sort of experience is incomparable to the experience of scrolling through twitter. In a way, I feel cared for. An artist's website is made with genuine concern for the content they are sharing. And I feel like you can see that in how a website is built. <br>
        My favorite metaphor Laurel offers is a website as a plant. I often become frustrated when a result I;m hoping for does not come soon enough.I look forward to trying to keep a patient mindset in creating a website for this class. Hopefully it can train my patience in everyday life.</p>

        <summary>A Rant on Technology by Ursula K. Le Guin</summary>
        <p>I just started reading Cloud Cuckoo Land by Anthony Doerr which is described as a historical fiction/science fiction/fantasy, none of which are my usual genres of choice. I’m more often reading a sappy coming of age Sally Rooney or an occasional romance. Interestingly enough, I am finding Cloud Cuckoo Land fairy easy to read through. And it's only because of how much he delves into the emotions and motivations of each character. I think that human emotion is the backbone of fiction. I’m no author but I cannot imagine reading or writing a book without consideration for the emotions my characters are feeling. I imagine that influencing reader emotion is one of the larger incentives of writing fiction as well. <br>
        Technology comes in the simplest of forms. The pencil I’m writing this entry with is technology. The screw top water bottle across from me is technology. Surely, human emotion can be considered technology — a rather complex kind of technology at that. I see the importance of considering human emotion in the art you create — the website. You want the user to feel like the experience they are undergoing is coming from another human, and there is a certain level of care in that. </p>
